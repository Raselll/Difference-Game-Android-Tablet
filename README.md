Difference Game for Android Tablet and Application : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1o43w6AWvxJtvbIW6nvbab6N495MQAWlR 

This is a follow-up to the previous project done in my repository titled 'Difference-Game-Website'. In fact, following a call for tender, myself and my 5 colleagues had to adapt the web project and then transform it into an application by adding additional features, in addition to replicating the same project on an Android tablet. Some of these new features promised in the call for tender were: the black and white theme, sending warning emails to a player, creating game sessions only among friends, player-participant authentication, accessing one's account and statistics, etc. This call for tender as well as the entire code for the diverse platforms can also be accessed by clicking on the drive link. The apk for the 2 environment can be found there !

Regarding the programming of the game on the tablet, it was coded in Flutter/Dart and a new database was used for player authentication, namely Firebase. In summary, the programming languages used in the complete project were JS, Flutter/Dart, HTML, CSS as well as Angular, and various databases (MongoDB and Firebase).
